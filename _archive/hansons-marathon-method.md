Hansons Marathon Method written by Luke Humphrey, an ex professional runner who is a member of
[Brooks distance project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansons-Brooks_Distance_Project). This training program
is designed and coached by Keith Hanson and Kevin Hanson - aka the Hansons brother. Their training method
is developed based on Arthur Lydiard, one of the outstanding athletics coaches. The book is dedicated to
how to train for a marathon, not just training plans but also everything that you should know about running
a marathon, which I find the content in the book very useful compared to other books.

## 1. Here is summary of the Hansons' training concept

- Hansons relies on the so-called "Cumulative Fatigue" which is the development of the long-terms effect.
  of pain through training that results in the increase of performance.
- Cumulative fatigue is a feeling of constant exhaustion that you can still handle.
- Cumulative fatigue is the level of pain that is in between proper pain and overtraining.
- Your running paces for different workouts are calculated based on your marathon goal. So it is recommended.
  that you should already have done a half marathon race (or at least 10k) so that you can estimate your goal.
- The book provides tables that you can use to quantify the pace for training.
- The training plan comprises of 4 phases: 
  - Base building
  - Speed training
  - Strength building
  - Tapering phase.
- Each week in each phase basically precribes 2-3 workouts, and the other days are easy run.
- Hansons call workout "Something of Substance (SOS)", which is the same as quality session used in Daniels' running formula.
- Hansons' SOS contains 3 workouts: interval, tempo, and long run.
- Interval training is devided into 2 sub-training: speed and strength workouts (corresponding to the phase).
- For tempo session Hansons suggests to run with your marathon pace.
- Long run is limited at 16 miles (26-27 km). Hansons explain that the 16-mile long run is the same as the last
  16 miles of your marathon race, not the first 16 miles.
- I find that Hansons training plan is tough and intensive, especially the strength phase. The reason for this
  is that Hansons want your legs to carry fatigue and get used to it so you always mimic a marathon with the long run.

## 2. Cumulative fatigue is not overtraining

One question that you might have is "How do I know if I'm doing cumulative fatigue and not overtraining?"

To determine if you're doing cumulative fatigue or overtraining, in the book it doesn't provide clear examples
of the cumulative fatigue, but only a list of the symptoms that tell you that you're overtraining. I then found
a very useful blog written by Luke Humphrey (the author of the book) that gives a clear list for the
comparison between cumulative fatigue and overtraining. ([see the blog](https://lukehumphreyrunning.com/discerning-between-cumulative-fatigue-and-overtraining/))

**Signes of Overtraining**

- Hard days are challenging
- Some stiffness and soreness will follow the hard days, but recovery within 48 hours
- General feeling of being challenged, but do feel like you have some reserve
- Fatigue and soreness occur but are temporary
- You sense getting stronger during the weeks
- Challenged but can handle it

**Signes of Cumulative Fatigue**

- A persistent, growing feeling of fatigue
- Sore legs at the start of runs
- Stiffness, general aches and pains
- More effort at the start of runs
- Hard days are challenging
- General feeling of fatigued, but some reserve left
- Challenged but can handle it
- Performance not affected, despite fatigue

## 3. Training plan

I follow the Advanced plan provided in the appendix of the book. There is also a plan for elite runners but
for me it's very intensive plan and not easy to follow, unless you have a lot of free time and strong passion
(the latter is more important, I think). The advanced plan basically puts interval (speed and strength) on Tuesday,
tempo on Thursday, and long run Sunday. The rest day is on Wednesday (you can do cross training instead) but
I can still handle the fatigue that I have in my legs so I still run on Wednesday.

The beginner and advanced training plans for half-marathon and marathon are available to

You can use [this calculator](https://lukehumphreyrunning.com/hmmcalculator/race_equivalency_calculator.php)
to check your pace for different workouts.
