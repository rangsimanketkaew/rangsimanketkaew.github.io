Doctoral student in theoretical chemistry and machine larning at UZH, Switzerland.
My research relies on atomistic quantum simulation with _ab initio_ molecular dynamics and enhanced sampling
for free energies calculations.

I am interested in applying statistical methods, such as machine learning, graph theory, symbolic regression,
to understanding chemical space and reactivity of molecules. My interest also extends to the development and
improvement of open-source software using cloud-based and full stack technology.

I am currently a member of [LightChEC](https://www.lightchec.uzh.ch/en.html) and
[NCCR Catalysis](https://www.nccr-catalysis.ch/) advised by Prof. Sandra Luber.
