I am a doctoral student in computational chemistry and machine larning.
My research relies on _ab initio_ quantum molecular dynamics and enhanced sampling
for free energies calculations of chemical reactions and molecular design.

I integrate electronic structure methods with statistical techniques, including machine learning, graph theory,
and symbolic regression, to explore chemical space and understand molecular reactivity.
I am also passionate about (open-source) software development with an emphasis on cloud computing,
high-perfermance computing, and full stack technology.

I am currently a member of [LightChEC](https://www.lightchec.uzh.ch/en.html) and
[NCCR Catalysis](https://www.nccr-catalysis.ch/) under the supervision of Prof. Sandra Luber.
