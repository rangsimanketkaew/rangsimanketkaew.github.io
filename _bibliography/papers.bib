	abstract = {Collective variables (CVs) are crucial parameters in enhanced sampling calculations and strongly impact the quality of the obtained free energy surface. However, many existing CVs are unique to and dependent on the system they are constructed with, making the developed CV non-transferable to other systems. Herein, we develop a non-instructor-led deep autoencoder neural network (DAENN) for discovering general-purpose CVs. The DAENN is used to train a model by learning molecular representations upon unbiased trajectories that contain only the reactant conformers. The prior knowledge of nonconstraint reactants coupled with the here-introduced topology variable and loss-like penalty function are only required to make the biasing method able to expand its configurational (phase) space to unexplored energy basins. Our developed autoencoder is efficient and relatively inexpensive to use in terms of a priori knowledge, enabling one to automatically search for hidden CVs of the reaction of interest.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
